# Automate-Boring-Stuff
For now, I'll be listing my notes below in this readme file. If it becomes problematic or clunky, I'll most likely move it to a different file.

# Chapter 1 notes

- The first chapter went over materials that are almost identical to what I learned in c++ so it was hard to take notes of "new" concepts

- The way the code is written was the biggest change moving from c++ to python for me
  - It seems like code can be written in a more direct manner, such as excluding "std::cout/endl" and even ";" at the end of a line

- The material that was almost, if not, identical to what I learned in c++ was the mathematical symbols, like basic operations, finding the remainder in division, etc.

- I think the hardest part about this chapter was navigating visual studio code since I did not use it while learning c++
  - If you're new to it as well, I would spend an hour or so just checking out the options, that helped me the most to figure out what was immediately useful for this chapter

- I took a peek at chapter 2 and noticed it covers logic, like if/else if/else statments, so I'm looking forward to learn how python handles these topics compared to c++

# Chapter 2 notes

- This chapter covers concepts including boolean values and operators, comparison operators, if/else/elif (else if) statements, while/for loops, break/continue statements, 
  -  An interesting topic this chapter went over is the "truthy" and "falsey" values as a different way to allow people reviewing your code to understand conditions in your loops, such as instead of using " variable != (value) " comparison, you could put " not (variable) " and make the variable an empty string or equal to 0
  -  Some new concepts I learned include the range function and its arguments, importing modules, 
     - The importing module section seems like its the same as using " include < __ > " in c++

# Chapter 3 notes

- This chapter covers concepts related to functions 
  - To create a function you would start with the def statement (ex, def function_one():)
  - Like in C++, we can add parameters inside of the parantheses of the function.
